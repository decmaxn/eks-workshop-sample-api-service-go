# Deploy the Official Kubernetes Dashboard
The official Kubernetes dashboard is not deployed by default, but there are instructions in the official documentation

We can deploy the dashboard with the following command:
```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v1.10.1/src/deploy/recommended/kubernetes-dashboard.yaml
```
Since this is deployed to our private cluster, we need to access it via a proxy. Kube-proxy is available to proxy our requests to the dashboard service. In your workspace, run the following command:
```
kubectl proxy --port=8080 --address='0.0.0.0' --disable-filter=true &
```
This will start the proxy, listen on port 8080, listen on all interfaces, and will disable the filtering of non-localhost requests.

This command will continue to run in the background of the current terminalâ€™s session.
